<h1>Java Software Engineering Projects</h1>

<p>
    A collection of Java projects illustrating OOP principles, Java basics, inheritance, interfaces, generics, and data structures. Covers design patterns, recursion, multithreading, error handling, and SOLID principles. Ideal for exploring foundational to advanced Java programming concepts and design techniques.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Battleship Game:</strong> Implements the classic Battleship game with an emphasis on algorithmic challenges, including grid management, ship placement, and hit/miss detection. Key focus on efficient algorithms for checking game conditions and optimizing the search space for computer players.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sliding Puzzle:</strong> A 2D sliding puzzle game highlighting the use of classes and heuristic search for efficient solutions. Involves working with data structures to represent the board and applying heuristic techniques (e.g., A* search) to find optimal moves and explore possible states.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Object Identity and Math Functions:</strong> Demonstrates object identity principles with a focus on <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>toString</code> operations. The math functionality component uses inheritance to create a hierarchy of mathematical operations, showcasing polymorphism and code reuse.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Playlist:</strong> A music playlist management system that emphasizes working with Java collections and data structures. Demonstrates handling exceptions, object copying, and iterator usage, providing a comprehensive look at manipulating and managing dynamic collections of items.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Recursion, Threads & Binary Trees:</strong> Combines recursive algorithms, multithreading, and binary tree operations. Covers recursive methods for traversing trees, implementing binary search, and leveraging threads for concurrent tree processing, providing a deeper understanding of parallel processing and tree-based data structures.
    </li>
</ul>
